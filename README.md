- 👋 Hi, I’m Omid!
- 🎓 I recently completed my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and am now diving deeper into the world of Data Science as an MSc student.
- 💻 My journey into Data Science is fueled by my passion for solving real-world problems using Python and SQL. I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights and making data-driven decisions.
- 👀 I’m particularly interested in AI, Machine Learning, and data engineering, and how they can be applied to create intelligent systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in advanced machine learning algorithms, data visualisation, and large-scale data processing.
- 🤝 I’m excited to collaborate on innovative projects involving data science, machine learning, and anything that merges hardware with AI solutions.
- 📫 You can reach me at o.sadeghi45@gmail.com. Always open for a chat or a potential collaboration!
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or analysing data, I'm building intricate LEGO creations! My collection is growing, and I love the challenge of bringing complex designs to life—whether it's with code or colorful bricks.
